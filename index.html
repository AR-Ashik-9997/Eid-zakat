        <h1>Learn About the Holy Sacrifice</h1>
        <p>
          Qurbani is the practice of sacrificing an animal for Allah (swt).
          Muslims around the world sacrifice an animal to mark the completion of
          Hajj. This practice commemorates the sacrifice of Ibrahim (as)
          thousands of years ago, who was prepared to sacrifice his beloved son
          for Allah’s sake Qurbani is not simply the slaughtering of an animal
          and the distribution of its meat, and it is more than a commemorative
          ritual....

        <h1>Story behind the Qurbani</h1>
        <p>
          When Ibrahim’s (as) firstborn son, Ismail (as) was old enough to walk
          around with his father and work with him, it was revealed in a dream
          to Ibrahim (as) that he must sacrifice his son. Ismail (as) did not
          question this command, just as his mother Hajar (as) had not
          questioned it when Allah commanded Ibrahim (as) to leave her and her
          baby son in the desert all those years ago....

        <h1>Benefits of Qurbani are given from the Almighty</h1>
        <p>The significance of Qurbani in Islam holds great value and is an act of devotion towards Allah (SWT), but it is also an act of giving to others in their time of need.</p>

            <h3>A Symbolic Sacrifice for Allah</h3>
            <p>The purpose of offering Qurbani is to draw near to Allah. Through Qurbani, we reaffirm what we sometimes forget in the hustle and bustle of everyday life – that we completely submit to Allah, and we are willing to sacrifice whatever is asked of us to be close to Him and gain His pleasure, just as Prophet Ibrahim (as) did so many years ago.Thus, an important part of Qurbani is remembering to hold onto our sincere intentions and striving to be closer to Allah through this symbolic sacrifice.</p>

            <h3>Story of Ibrahim (as) and his son</h3>
            <p>As Ibrahim (as) prepared a knife to sacrifice his son and a shroud to bury him in, he couldn’t face Ismail (as), so he turned his son’s face away. According to Ibn Kasir’s Tafseer, they both remembered Allah and testified their faith in Him – Ibrahim because he was about to make a sacrifice, and Ismail because he was about to die. Then Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son – and when the knife was at Ismail’s neck, he heard a voice calling to him to stop.</p>

            <p>The family of Ibrahim (as) is a particularly important part of our history, as we learn every year at Hajj when we commemorate their actions.
              The Messenger of Allah (saw) even said, ‘I am the son of two sacrificed people’ (Hakim), referring to the fact that both his father Abdullah and his ancestor Ismail (as) were almost sacrificed for Allah’s sake, emphasizing his connection with Ismail (as).</p>

            <h3>A Celebration with the Ummah</h3>
            <p>This is the Qurbani we still practice today every Eid al-Adha and it is important for us to not only make our intentions sincere but also to keep in mind the rich history behind Qurbani. Our heritage should be valuable to us, as shown by the Prophet (saw) keeping the horns of the ram Ibrahim (as) hanging in the Kaaba. The family of Ibrahim (as) is a particularly important part of our history, as we learn every year at Hajj when we commemorate their actions.</p>

            <h3>Zakat Fund</h3>
            <p>On the authority of Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allah said, ‘When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (a continuous charity), or knowledge from which benefit is gained, or a righteous child who prays for him. [Muslim].A charity that he gives out of his property during his life while he is in sound health. He will continue to receive a reward for all these even after his death.</p>

            <h3>Zakat Fund</h3>
            <p>Sadaqah jariyah or continuous charity means the charity whose reward continues for its donor and it is recorded in his good deeds even after his death. Normal sadaqah on the other hand benefits the donor on a single occasion and is recorded as one good deed depending on the intention and Allah can multiply it much further InshaAllah.The virtues of such deeds lie in the reward which continues even after the death of the person.</p>

            <h3>Zakat Fund</h3>
            <p>The Reward of Charity on Behalf of the Deceased Reaches Him. The degree of reward is not similar for all the deeds; rather, it varies from one act of charity to another based on its type, effects and the need of people for that charity.that whatever a person eats is that which is gone and no longer remains, but that which he gives in charity is what will remain for him with Allah and he will benefit from it on the Day of Resurrection</p>
